# Insight presentation - July 11 2016
## Objective: Use statistics, time series and machine learning to characterize 'tweeter speech' from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: What can we learn about their tweets?

### Analysis keypoints:
1. Use tweepy to download the tweets authored by each candidate.
2. Analysis of Hashtag frequency - What can we learn?
3. Time series analysis - Number of tweets/correlation - Locate peaks
4. Word histogram - What are the words more frequently used by either candidate? What can we learn?
5. But... humans are biased, are they not? Can we do better? Use machine learning!
6. What about unsupervised learning? Does a predictive model make sense?
